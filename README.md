## Python Rookie Bruteforce Code:

As part of a CTF challenge I was tasked to write a Python script to bruteforce the decryption key of an encrypted file.

Bruteforcing is the act of repeatedly trying different combinations to break the password encryption (based on either randomly generated passwords, or from a list of passwords to try). In this task I used the wordlist from Rockyou - a widely know password wordlist that contains thousands of common passwords in one wordlist.
